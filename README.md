# Welcome ^.^
Hi there! My name is Luisa. I'm a recent graduate from McMaster University in Hamilton, ON, where I studied Chemical Biology. While I loved my time in undergrad and found laboratory research extremely rewarding, I'm also super passionate about big data and programming. Which is why...

🚀I've embarked on a journey to combine all of my interests into a career in Data Science!

I'm currently learning:
#Python #JavaScript #SQL #R #OCI

✌️Thanks for checking out my portfolio, hope you visit again soon!
